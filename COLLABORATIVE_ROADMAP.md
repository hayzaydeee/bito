# 🤝 Bito Collaborative Features - Technical Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision: Notion-Style Workspaces for Habit Tracking

Transform Bito into a collaborative platform where teams, families, and communities can track habits together while maintaining individual privacy and motivation.

---

## 📋 Core Features Overview

### 🏢 Workspaces
- **Shared Environment**: Teams can create workspaces for collective habit tracking
- **Individual Dashboards**: Each member has their personal view within the workspace
- **Team Overview**: Centralized view of everyone's progress and achievements
- **Privacy Controls**: Granular permissions for what's shared vs. private

### 👥 Collaboration Types
1. **Family Workspaces**: Parents & children tracking healthy routines
2. **Fitness Groups**: Workout accountability and progress sharing
3. **Work Teams**: Professional development and wellness goals
4. **Study Groups**: Academic habits and learning consistency
5. **Accountability Partners**: 1-on-1 habit support systems
6. **Community Challenges**: Large-scale habit challenges

### Database Schema Extensions

#### New Models Needed:
```javascript
// Workspace Model
const workspaceSchema = {
  name: String,
  description: String,
  type: ['family', 'team', 'fitness', 'study', 'community'],
  ownerId: ObjectId,
  settings: {
    isPublic: Boolean,
    allowInvites: Boolean,
    requireApproval: Boolean,
    privacyLevel: ['open', 'members-only', 'invite-only']
  },
  members: [{
    userId: ObjectId,
    role: ['owner', 'admin', 'member', 'viewer'],
    joinedAt: Date,
    status: ['active', 'invited', 'suspended']
  }],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}

// Workspace Habits (shared habit templates)
const workspaceHabitSchema = {
  workspaceId: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  description: String,
  category: String,
  isRequired: Boolean, // Must all members track this?
  createdBy: ObjectId,
  settings: {
    visibility: ['all', 'admins-only', 'self-only'],
    allowCustomization: Boolean,
    defaultTarget: {
      value: Number,
      unit: String
    }
  }
}

// Member Habits (individual instances of workspace habits)
const memberHabitSchema = {
  workspaceId: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId,
  workspaceHabitId: ObjectId, // Reference to workspace template
  personalSettings: {
    target: { value: Number, unit: String },
    reminderTime: String,
    isPrivate: Boolean
  },
  isActive: Boolean
}

// Activity Feed
const activitySchema = {
  workspaceId: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId,
  type: ['habit_completed', 'streak_achieved', 'goal_reached', 'joined_workspace'],
  data: Object, // Flexible data for different activity types
  visibility: ['public', 'workspace', 'private'],
  createdAt: Date
}

// Workspace Invitations
const invitationSchema = {
  workspaceId: ObjectId,
  invitedBy: ObjectId,
  email: String,
  role: String,
  token: String,
  status: ['pending', 'accepted', 'declined', 'expired'],
  expiresAt: Date,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

This roadmap transforms Bito from a personal habit tracker into a comprehensive collaborative platform that can compete with established team productivity tools while maintaining its focus on habit formation and personal growth.

The phased approach ensures we can validate each feature set before building the next, and the technical architecture supports scaling from small family groups to large enterprise teams.

The code foundation is ready - you now have the database models, API structure, and UI components to start building the collaborative features immediately!
