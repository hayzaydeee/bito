# Group Accountability System - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the transformation from the current workspace system from individual dashboards within groups to a true accountability-focused group tracking system where members monitor each other's progress on shared habits.

## Current vs New Ideology

### Current System
- Groups have workspace habits as templates
- Members adopt habits into separate `MemberHabit` tracking
- "My Dashboard" within workspace shows personal progress
- Limited accountability features

### New System
- Groups have habit templates that members can adopt
- Adopted habits become regular personal habits (unified system)
- "Group Trackers" page shows all members' progress on shared habits
- Dedicated member widgets for detailed progress monitoring
- Enhanced accountability and social features

## Implementation Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Data Model Restructuring - COMPLETED

**✅ 1.1 Modify Habit Model**
- ✅ Add `source` field to distinguish between personal and workspace-adopted habits
- ✅ Add `workspaceHabitId` reference for adopted habits  
- ✅ Add `workspaceId` for workspace context
- ✅ Add workspace privacy settings (`workspaceSettings`)
- ✅ Add workspace-specific methods for privacy and interaction controls
- ✅ Add proper indexes for workspace queries
- ✅ Test validation and functionality

**✅ 1.2 Create Migration Script**
- ✅ Create migration script to convert `MemberHabit` entries to `Habit` entries
- ✅ Test migration logic
- ✅ Preserve all existing functionality and stats

**✅ 1.3 Verify HabitEntry Compatibility**
- ✅ Confirm HabitEntry model works seamlessly with unified system
- ✅ Post-save middleware will update stats for both personal and workspace habits

### ✅ Phase 2: Backend API Updates - COMPLETED

**✅ 2.1 Update Habit Adoption Flow**
- ✅ Modified adoption endpoint to create regular `Habit` entries instead of `MemberHabit`
- ✅ Added workspace context tracking
- ✅ Updated validation for new workspace settings
- ✅ Updated member-habits endpoint to use unified system

**✅ 2.2 Create Group Tracking APIs**
- ✅ `GET /api/workspaces/:id/group-trackers` - Get all members' progress on shared habits
- ✅ `GET /api/workspaces/:id/member-stats/:userId` - Get specific member's shared habit stats
- ✅ `GET /api/workspaces/:id/shared-habits-overview` - Overview stats for workspace

**✅ 2.3 Privacy & Permission System**
- ✅ Implemented workspace privacy controls (shareProgress, allowInteraction, shareInActivity)
- ✅ Role-based access controls for viewing member data
- ✅ Privacy filtering that respects user preferences

### ✅ Phase 3: Frontend - Unified Habit System - COMPLETED

**✅ 3.1 Update Personal Dashboard**

  - ✅ Created Encouragement model with comprehensive tracking
  - ✅ Built encouragement API endpoints (send, receive, respond, mark read)
  - ✅ Implemented EncouragementModal component for sending encouragements
  - ✅ Built EncouragementFeed component for workspace activity
  - ✅ Integrated encouragement features into GroupTrackersPage
  - ✅ Added encourage buttons for members and individual habits
- ✅ Group challenges and milestones (GroupChallenges component)
- ✅ Leaderboards and recognition (GroupLeaderboard component with ranking system)

**✅ 5.2 Advanced Analytics**
- ✅ Group performance trends (integrated into leaderboard)
- ✅ Comparative analysis between members (leaderboard rankings)
- ✅ Score-based performance tracking with multiple metrics

### ✅ Phase 6: Polish & Testing - COMPLETED

**✅ 6.1 Migration & Data Integrity**
- ✅ Fixed import errors in UI components (icon imports)
- ✅ Fixed backend API endpoint mismatches and authentication
- ✅ Resolved frontend data structure issues in widgets
- ✅ Verified all group accountability functionality works
- ✅ Tested widget-based architecture with BaseGridContainer

**✅ 6.2 UI/UX Improvements**
- ✅ Implemented consistent widget-based design language
- ✅ Refactored GroupTrackersPage to use BaseGridContainer architecture
- ✅ Fixed widget error boundaries and data flow
- ✅ Performance optimizations through proper data extraction

## Key Data Model Changes

### Modified Habit Model
```javascript
{
  // Existing fields...
  
  // New workspace-related fields
  source: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['personal', 'workspace'],
    default: 'personal'
  },
  workspaceId: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Workspace',
    required: function() { return this.source === 'workspace'; }
  },
  workspaceHabitId: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'WorkspaceHabit',
    required: function() { return this.source === 'workspace'; }
  },
  workspaceSettings: {
    shareProgress: {
      type: String,
      enum: ['full', 'progress-only', 'streaks-only', 'private'],
      default: 'progress-only'
    },
    allowMemberAccess: {
      type: Boolean,
      default: false
    }
  }
}
```

### New Encouragement Model
```javascript
{
  fromUser: { type: ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  toUser: { type: ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  workspace: { type: ObjectId, ref: 'Workspace', required: true },
  habit: { type: ObjectId, ref: 'Habit', default: null },
  type: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['general_support', 'streak_celebration', 'goal_achieved', 'comeback_support', 'milestone_reached', 'custom_message'],
    default: 'general_support'
  },
  message: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 500 },
  reaction: { type: String, enum: ['👏', '🔥', '💪', '⭐', '🎉', '👊', '💯', '🚀'], default: '👏' },
  isRead: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  readAt: Date,
  response: {
    message: { type: String, maxlength: 300 },
    respondedAt: Date
  },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
}
```

### Migration Strategy
1. Convert all `MemberHabit` records to `Habit` records with `source: 'workspace'`
2. Preserve all tracking data and personal settings
3. Update all API endpoints to use unified `Habit` model
4. Remove `MemberHabit` model and related code

## API Changes

### New Endpoints
- `GET /api/workspaces/:id/group-trackers` - Group accountability page data
- `GET /api/workspaces/:id/member-progress/:userId` - Individual member tracking

- `PUT /api/encouragements/:id/read` - Mark encouragement as read
- `PUT /api/encouragements/:id/respond` - Respond to an encouragement
- `GET /api/encouragements/stats` - Get encouragement statistics

### Modified Endpoints

- `GET /api/habits` - Now includes workspace-adopted habits
- `GET /api/workspaces/:id/overview` - Updated to exclude personal dashboard link
